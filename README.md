## Panopticon
Panopticon is a security system that utilises EMGU, a cross-platform .NET wrapper for OpenCV, and AForge.NET to implement facial recognition and detection. This system aims to provide information about the number of individuals present in a room and the time of their appearance. It can be used by companies to help them save on a security budget and to monitor more efficiently.
